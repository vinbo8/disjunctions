## _post_-machina is a journal is run by critical researchers and practitioners of science and technology.

We work to author, translate, and publish knowledge focused on today’s digital realities and the vast transformation of society brought about by technological advances. Our focus is both practical and theoretical. We, therefore, solicit content of all kinds – from anti-surveillance guides to subversive uses of technology, from theories of digital labour to anti-colonial technoscience.

_post_-machina aims to create a point of convergence for work seeking to explain and unravel the developing hegemony of technoscientific capitalism in the digital age. In doing so, XXX centres the dynamics of this transformation in the global South while also rejecting its essentialisation as intrinsically separate or other. We seek to highlight the specificities of the development of technology as conditioned by capitalist relations of production. In doing so, we draw inspiration from the struggles of the industrial era’s working classes and their demands for autonomy over technological progress and for knowledge about the machines that they encountered in the factories: how to design and operate them, the science behind their development, the symbolic languages used to formalise them; and just as significantly, their political economy and their educational, social, and cognitive dimensions.
