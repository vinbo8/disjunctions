title: About

This is a journal run by researchers and practitioners connected to the global South. We work to author, translate, and publish knowledge with a focus on today’s digital realities, and the vast transformation of society brought about by advances in digital technology. Our focus is both practical and theoretical. We therefore solicit content of all kinds – from anti-surveillance guides to subsersive uses of technology; from theories of digital labour to decolonial technoscience.

<name> aims to create a point of convergence for work seeking to unravel and explain the developing hegemony of technocapitalism in a digital age. In doing so, we explicitly centers the dynamics of this transformation in the global South, at the same time rejecting essentialisation of the South as intrinsically separate or other. We seek to highlight the specificities of the paths of development of technology, as conditioned by capitalist relations of production. In doing so, we draw inspiration from the struggles of the industrial era’s working classes, and their demands for autonomy over technological progress, and for knowledge about the machines that they encountered in the factories: how to design and operate them, the science behind their development, the symbolic languages used to formalise them; and just as significantly, their political economy and their educational, social, and cognitive dimensions.
